        "\n",
        "This project is a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to upload a video file and analyze its content using Google's Gemini API. The application leverages the capabilities of large language models to extract insights from video content and have various uses, some of which are mentioned below:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Research and Academic Projects**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Lecture Summarization:** Quickly extract key points from academic lectures or research presentations.\n",
        "*   **Qualitative Research:** Analyze interviews or focus group discussions for patterns and themes.\n",
        "*   **Experiment Documentation:** Review and summarize laboratory experiment recordings.\n",
